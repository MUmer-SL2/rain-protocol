## `TierByConstruction`

Enforces tiers held by contract contruction block.
The construction block is compared against the blocks returned by `report`.
The `ITier` contract is paramaterised and set during construction.



### `onlyTier(address account_, enum ITier.Tier minimumTier_)`

Modifier that restricts access to functions depending on the tier required by the function.

`isTier` involves an external call to tierContract.report.
`require` happens AFTER the modified function to avoid rentrant `ITier` code.
Also `report` from `ITier` is `view` so the compiler will error on attempted state modification.

Do NOT use this to guard setting the tier on an ITier contract.
The initial tier would be checked AFTER it has already been modified which is unsafe.






### `constructor(contract ITier tierContract_)` (public)





### `isTier(address account_, enum ITier.Tier minimumTier_) â†’ bool` (public)

Check if an account has held AT LEAST the given tier according to `tierContract` since construction.
The account MUST have held the tier continuously from construction until the "current" state according to `report`.
Note that `report` PROBABLY is current as at the block this function is called but MAYBE NOT.
The `ITier` contract is free to manage reports however makes sense to it.
