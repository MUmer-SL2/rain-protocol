## `PrestigeByConstruction`

Enforces prestige levels by contract contruction block.
The construction block is compared against the blocks returned by `statusReport`.
The `IPrestige` contract is paramaterised and set during construction.



### `onlyStatus(address account, enum IPrestige.Status status)`

Modifier that restricts access to functions depending on the status required by the function.

`isStatus` involves an external call to prestige.statusReport.
`require` happens AFTER the modified function to avoid rentrant `IPrestige` code.
Also `statusReport` from `IPrestige` is `view` so the compiler will error state modification.

Do NOT use this to guard setting the status on an IPrestige contract.
The initial status would be checked AFTER it has already been modified which is unsafe.






### `constructor(contract IPrestige _prestige)` (public)





### `isStatus(address account, enum IPrestige.Status status) â†’ bool` (public)

Check if an account has held AT LEAST the given status according to `prestige` since construction.
The account MUST have held the status continuously from construction until the "current" state according to `statusReport`.
Note that `statusReport` PROBABLY is current as at the block this function is called but MAYBE NOT.
The `IPrestige` contract is free to manage status reports however makes sense to it.
