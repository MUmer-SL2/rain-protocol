parameters (can both be zero).</p><p>The distribution is considered successful if the total reserve deposited in the Balancer pool during the distribution phase (in addition to the initial seed) covers all three.</p><p>In the case of a successful raise:</p><ul><li>The creator raise will be forwarded to the creator</li><li>The seeder will receive their original seed plus the seed fee minus

nothing</li><li>The seeder receives their original seed minus pool dust</li><li>All remaining reserve assets are forwarded to the <code>RedeemableERC20</code> contract (can be redeemed via. burns)</li></ul><p>Note that reserve assets forwarded to the <code>RedeemableERC20</code> contract are redeemed pro-rata in both cases. This means that in the case of a failed raise a token holder could redeem their tokens for more or less reserve than they swapped originally, as they will be redeeming for the <em>average</em> swap value, not <em>their</em> swap value.</p><p>This mechanism:</p><ul><li>Protects everyone in the case that the raised reserve is too low for the creator to do what they wanted</li><li>Incentivises token purchases when the price is lower than average if a raise is close to failing, thus making it more likely to succeed</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="maximum-raise"></a>Maximum raise<a class="hash-link" href="#maximum-raise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The creator starts the price of tokens high in their own estimation, with the price gradually declining over the distribution.</p><p>This protects the creator from over-raising and being unable to deliver.</p><p>For example, an indie painter can only produce a few thousand $ worth of value in a single painting, if they raise a million $ they aren&#x27;t suddenly going to paint the Mona Lisa.</p><p>Raising too much can be just as problematic as raising too little, so we do our best to help creators raise &quot;a lot&quot; while still appropriately sizing all the parameters.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="stuck-amm"></a>Stuck AMM<a class="hash-link" href="#stuck-amm" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The traditional approach of simply adding tokens to a pool on Uniswap results in a situation where the price can get &#x27;stuck&#x27;.</p><p>This means that early FOMO causes the first buyers pump the price very high on a single exchange, then nobody else can buy until some of these early buyers then sell tokens back to the AMM (direct spot price drop) or the market (arbitrage opportunity to recover price).</p><p>Given that the whole point of distributing tokens is to get them in the hands of fans who should want to hodl them up to and beyond the start of the redemption period, we do NOT want to rely on secondary market selling just to allow more buyers to join.</p><p>Put another way, the traditional approach <em>relies on scalpers</em> to acheive smooth price discovery rather than a single pump then price stagnation.</p><p>The mitigation is to use a combination of weights and amounts to define the spot price. This allows the weights to be adjusted downwards, lowering the spot price <em>without</em> trades occuring, rewarding <em>later</em> participants who are patient enough to allow the weights to give a better price for the same token supply in the AMM.</p><p>Rewarding later participants rewards patience.</p><p>Patient token buyers are more likely to be patient token hodlers.</p><p>Patient token hodlers are more likely to enjoy and maximise the redemption phase.</p><p>For example, Uniswap has a fixed weight of 1:1 and relies on arbitrage with external systems to maintain a fair spot price (i.e. Uniswap by definition assumes whatever token quantities are in any given pool are always of equivalent value).
Balancer does NOT assume the tokens in a given pool are of equal value, it allows any weighting of either token up to a 50:1 ratio (i.e. the total value of one token is up to 50x more than the other token).
When we can change the weighting of the tokens we can change the spot price without changing the token amounts.</p><p>The weight curve is defined during the <code>Trust</code> deployment and kicked off during <code>anonStartDistribution</code>.</p><p>Anyone can call the &quot;update weights gradually&quot; function on the pool, it is a public method, which brings the pool <em>weights</em> back to the predefined curve according to the current block, which brings the spot price down. This means an arbitrage opportunity <em>against the weights</em> exists and grows each block, where any user can call the weight recalculation function to give themselves a better spot price for the trade they want to make.</p><p>Ignoring stampedes (many redundant weight updates in the same block) and MEV/front-running (another user positions their trade after the rebalance but before the desired trade), it is always profitable to rebalance the weights if the new spot price is better than the fees of the rebalance. This is because the weights monotonically drift downwards towards the book value floor.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="overweight-pool"></a>Overweight pool<a class="hash-link" href="#overweight-pool" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Balancer pools can never exceed a combined weight of <code>50</code> as the sum of the weights of the tokens.</p><p>This is true even during a single operation so Balancer recommend never setting weights at exactly <code>50</code> if they need to change.</p><p>We do need them to change according to the reweighting curve so there is a <code>POOL_HEADROOM</code> constant (currently <code>10 ** 18</code> which is &quot;one&quot; for Balancer math).
We require that the <code>Trust</code> bootstraps with combined weights equal to or lower than <code>BalancerConstants.MAX_WEIGHT - Constants.POOL_HEADROOM</code>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="impermanent-loss--price-dumping"></a>Impermanent loss &amp;&amp; price dumping<a class="hash-link" href="#impermanent-loss--price-dumping" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Impermanent Loss (IL) is a near-ubiquitious issue in AMMs to be mitigated or at least discussed.</p><p>In our case, because the Trust enforces that 100% of the freshly minted token is provided as liquidity in the AMM pool, the concept of IL doesn&#x27;t quite apply.</p><p>While it is true mathematically that, had the Trust hodled the tokens instead of providing them as liqudity, it would receive more value than putting them on the market, this is nonsensical in practise as hodling 100% of the tokens implies that there is no distribution and therefore no meaningful market!</p><p>The worst case scenario is that zero trades occur, or equivalently, 100% of the token supply is dumped back into the pool in the same block that redemptions are unblocked.
In the worst case scenario, because the final weights are calculated against the final valuation that covers at leat the seeder, and the excess is forwarded to token holders, even the maximum theoretical token dump is safe for participants (albeit disappointing).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="pool-dust"></a>Pool dust<a class="hash-link" href="#pool-dust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Balancer pools cannot be totally shutdown (this has been confirmed by the Balancer team) so the larger of <code>10^-7</code> times the final reserve or <code>10 ** 6</code> absolute units of the reserve will be trapped in the pool on distribution end.</p><p>This is unavoidable but usually harmless. The limitation gets worse for reserve assets with fewer <code>decimals</code>. For example, USDC and USDT only support <code>6</code> decimals rather than the standard <code>18</code> decimals for native erc20 tokens. This means that the minimum pool dust is $1 of USDC or USDT.</p><p>For this reason we require that the minimum seed is <code>10 ** 8</code> ($100 for stables) so that the maximum theroetical pool dust is capped at 1% of the initial seed.</p><p>This could make tokens with very small decimals in the range of <code>0 - 5</code> infeasible as reserve assets due to the minimum seed requirements being too large in the reserve denomination.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="rounding-errors"></a>Rounding errors<a class="hash-link" href="#rounding-errors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are some rounding errors when burning/redeeming tokens that can cause the pro-rate token calculations to differ by one or two in absolute terms between otherwise identical redemptions.</p><p>For tokens with <code>10 ** 18</code> decimals this should be harmless as the rounding error will be <code>10 ^ -18</code>.</p><p>For tokens with very small decimals this may be problematic.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="whales"></a>Whales<a class="hash-link" href="#whales" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Whales are a double edged sword in general.</p><p>On one hand it is great when a large investor takes interest in a project as it is a big vote of confidence.</p><p>Whales may represent a buyer with long term goals well aligned with the team, or they may simply be taking advantage of a short term exploitable situation.</p><p>The redeemable tokens being bootstrapped here are designed specifically for fans of the underlying IP to participate in Tokens-as-an-Event (<code>TaaE</code>).</p><p>While healthy speculation (free market price discovery) is one of the main goals of the distribution and redemption mechanisms, outright market manipulation for the gain of a few actors with disproportionate control over price is NOT desirable (e.g. pump and dump).</p><p>One of the difficulties of mitigating whales is that there is always grey area in defining what &#x27;a whale&#x27; is and what the difference between &#x27;price discovery&#x27; and &#x27;manipulation&#x27; is,</p><p>Commonly whales also have ready access to &#x27;soft&#x27; control over the marketplace like bots, hired technocrats, insider information, etc. in addition to their raw buying power.</p><p>Rather than trying to define rules or whitelisting accounts or taking a &#x27;top down&#x27; approach we choose to disincentivise whales at the level of the token and AMM mechanics.</p><ol start="0"><li>The Dutch Auction style AMM means that whales cannot bulk buy in the first block with a bot to achieve immediate control over the token</li><li>The Trust contract minting and controlling 100% of the supply (rather than the trust owner) means that nobody can &#x27;premint&#x27; tokens for their whale-friends behind closed doors</li><li>The transaction freezing in the redemption phase means that whales have no ability to trade publically or privately in order to manipulate market prices, only their personal relationship with their own holdings are relevant in this phase</li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="scalpers"></a>Scalpers<a class="hash-link" href="#scalpers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Scalpers are always bad for users who want to use the token for its utility.</p><p>Scalpers have no intent on using (hodling for rewards) the token and simply want to arbitrage &#x27;being first in line&#x27; against &#x27;not being first in line&#x27; for some scarce resource.</p><p>In a traditional setting (e.g. tickets for a live event) scalpers are also bad for the event producer because they extract value from the event without adding value (i.e. the event producer receives less money than they could have).</p><p>In a setting where the AMM is initialized with 100% of the token supply the event producer theoretically benefits from scalping as they ultimately exit with the total premium of all trades.</p><p>In reality scalping still hurts the creator as well as users because the premium relative to the reserve asset should reach an equilibrium with the expected value of the rewards during the redemption phase. If a scalper manages to put a large premium on the token price paid by users of the utility of the token then the redemption phase will be less valuable - i.e. the creator will need to produce more value to at their own cost match the premium gap that the scalper extracted for themselves. Intuitively, using the live concert example, the event producer may be targeting $100 of value per ticket but scalpers pushing the price up to $200 per ticket will inevitably warp the event-goers expectations of &#x27;good value&#x27; despite being fully aware of the scalping premium.</p><p>Scalping is mitigated by starting the price much higher than the creator expects anybody to pay, i.e. the creator is communicating to the audience &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to produce that much value for <em>any</em> user, so please wait for the weights to settle a bit before aping in.&quot; This also removes both the ability to (no early low price) and incentive to (expectation setting) scalp tokens.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="rampant-speculation"></a>Rampant speculation<a class="hash-link" href="#rampant-speculation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Speculation is the norm in crypto assets.</p><p>We want to create a <em>relatively</em> safe environment for our users.</p><p>This means the token should never go to zero (bad for hodlers) or to the moon (prices out new participants).</p><p>We don&#x27;t subscribe to the idea that speculation is zero sum because token sales by the creator ultimately pay the cost of producing the value created by the creator, regardless of whether an individual trader takes a profit or loss. As long as there are users buying the token with the primary goal to achieve newly created value, and the creator delivers on this value creation, then issuance and purchase of the token is a win/win for the creator and token holders.</p><p>So <em>some</em> speculation is healthy and even fun but as all good things, in moderation.</p><p>We effectively clamp the speculation between an upper and lower bound.</p><p>Token holders should be actively educated and encouraged to never buy above the initial spot price, because they can always wait for the weights to rebalance and bring the price down.</p><p>The spot price on the Balancer AMM can never drop below the redemption/book value because this is equivalent to dumping 100% of all tokens minted back to the AMM at the very final block of the weight redistribution, i.e. the lowest price. The redemption value is a fixed minimum because nobody, not even the creator or deployer, can withdraw the reserve token from the redeemable token without calling the <code>redeem</code> function. The redemption value can increase over time due to additional reserve deposits but never drop below the floor established at <code>Trust</code> initialization (sans gas fees).</p><p>If you subscribe to the idea that crypto assets &#x27;have no intrinsic value&#x27; and therefore they are 100% speculative, then having this token drop to the redemption value is the same as it dropping to zero. I.e. when the token reaches the book value, 100% of the speculative premium has been lost. However, by setting a redemption value for the token, we force buyers to match a non-zero non-speculative value on the token that locks up capital before they can consider speculating.
When a buyer purchases a vanilla ERC20 on the open market, 100% of the price they pay is subject to speculation (loss), whereas a redeemable token may be valued as 50% speculative and 50% stable/reserve, which should dampen price swings similar to a traditional diversified portfolio of assets.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="front-running--mev"></a>Front running &amp;&amp; MEV<a class="hash-link" href="#front-running--mev" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Balancer does NOT have a general solution for front-running or MEV as far as I am aware.</p><p>The general problem is that someone (bot) can observe the mempool (pending transactions), the state of the blockchain including all available contracts, and execute some combination of transactions before and after (an arsehole sandwich) that profits the bot at the expense of the owner of the pending transaction as it finalises.</p><p>A simple and relevant example is slippage on an AMM. If Alice places a large trade with 10% slippage then Bob can buy ahead of Alice (by being a miner or paying more gas to a miner), forcing Alice to pay an even higher price due to Bob&#x27;s slippage, then Bob can immediately dump (by being a miner or paying slightly less gas to a miner) and arbitrage Alice&#x27;s slippage.</p><p>This problem is old, it is called &#x27;front running&#x27; because brokers would literally run between desks to place their own trades ahead of the trades of their client&#x27;s.</p><p>The LBP does have a saving grace in that it passively incentivises relatively small and patient trades through the weight rebalancing. Ignoring gas fees, a simple and safe strategy as a participant in the distribution phase is to Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into the pool to minimise slippage and take advantage of lowering weights without missing the opportunity of high stock of token on sale.
Small trades are less profitable to front run as the slippage and therefore arbitrage opportunity is smaller in both percentage and absolute terms for the bot.</p><p>The Balancer contract <em>mitigates</em> front running and slippage opportunities by exposing parameters that will revert the transaction if a minimum price is exceeded.
If the parameters are set sensibly then any attempt at front-running (or an extra frothy market) will trip the safety on the trade and it will fail. The buyer will still need to pay gas up to the point of the reversion but they will not be forced to accept malicious or extreme slippage.</p><p><strong>The GUI SHOULD expose or set the price thresholds for each trade to mitigate front-running.</strong></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="rug-pull"></a>Rug pull<a class="hash-link" href="#rug-pull" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A rug pull is a common scam where a &#x27;team&#x27; (usually anon) mints a token, creates an AMM pool (e.g. TKN/WETH), promotes the token and then after a significant amount of the counter token (e.g. WETH) accumulates they mint a huge amount of the token to clear out the AMM pool.</p><p>Effectively it is a reboot of the old ICO exit scams but facilitated by an AMM.</p><p>The <code>Trust</code> contract does not construct or mint any tokens that can be rugged as all token supply changes are behind functions owned/administered by the <code>Trust</code> itself.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="non-delivery-by-the-creator"></a>Non-delivery by the creator<a class="hash-link" href="#non-delivery-by-the-creator" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>The creator CAN always fail to deliver meaningful value during the redeem phase</strong>.</p><p>Any user that loses faith in the ability of the creator to deliver can always redeem their tokens during the redemption phase for a pro-rata withdrawal of the current balances of the <code>RedeemableERC20</code> contract.</p><p>The intent is that many (hundreds or even thousands) of <code>Trust</code> contracts are created over time by many creators.</p><p>This is mitigated by the curation of front ends that present <code>Trust</code> contracts to end-users.
