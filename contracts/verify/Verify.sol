/// Trust-minimised contract to record the state of some verification process.
/// When some off-chain identity is to be reified on chain there is inherently
/// some multi-party, multi-faceted trust relationship. For example, the DID
/// (Decentralized Identifiers) specification from W3C outlines that the
/// controller and the subject of an identity are two different entities.
///
/// This is because self-identification is always problematic to the point of
/// being uselessly unbelievable.
///
/// For example, I can simply say "I am the queen of England" and what
/// onchain mechanism could possibly check, let alone stop me?
/// The same problem exists in any situation where some priviledge or right is
/// associated with identity. Consider passports, driver's licenses,
/// celebrity status, age, health, accredited investor, social media account,
/// etc. etc.
///
/// Typically crypto can't and doesn't want to deal with this issue. The usual
/// scenario is that some system demands personal information, which leads to:
///
/// - Data breaches that put individual's safety at risk. Consider the December
///   2020 leak from Ledger that dumped 270 000 home addresses and phone
///   numbers, and another million emails, of hardware wallet owners on a
///   public forum.
/// - Discriminatory access, undermining an individual's self-sovereign right
///   to run a full node, self-host a GUI and broadcast transactions onchain.
///   Consider the dydx airdrop of 2021 where metadata about a user's access
///   patterns logged on a server were used to deny access to presumed
///   Americans over regulatory fears.
/// - An entrenched supply chain of centralized actors from regulators, to
///   government databases, through KYC corporations, platforms, etc. each of
///   which holds an effective monopoly over, and ability to manipulate user's
///   "own" identity.
///
/// These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the
/// safety of an opt-in, permissionless system based on pseudonomous actors
/// self-signing actions into a shared space.
///
/// That said, one can hardly expect a permissionless pseudonomous system
/// founded on asynchronous value transfers to succeed without at least some
/// concept of curation and reputation.
///
/// Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?
///
/// Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain
/// can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.
///
/// Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government
/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against
/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to
/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project
/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an
/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in
/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about
/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.
///
/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:
///
/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific
///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.
/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced in some
///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or
///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The evidence is passed to the
///   `Verify` contract as raw bytes so it is opaque onchain, but visible as an
///   event to verifiers.
/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to initialize their state and
///   emit the evidence for their account, after which they _cannot change_
///   their submission without appealing to someone who can remove. This costs
///   gas, so why don't we simply ask the user to sign something and have an
///   approver verify the signed data? Because we want to leverage both the
///   censorship resistance and asynchronous nature of the underlying
///   blockchain. Assuming there are N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of
///   those N approvers to be able to review and approve an application. If the
///   user is forced to submit their application directly to one SPECIFIC
///   approver we lose this property. In the gasless model the user must then
///   rely on their specific approver both being online and not to censor the
///   request. It's also possible that many accounts add the same evidence,
///   after all it will be public in the event logs, so it is important for
///   approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and evidence.
/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the evidence by
///   inspecting the event logs. IF the evidence is valid then the `approve`
///   function should be called by the approver.
/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior
///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was
///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the
///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is
///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to
///   resubmit new fraudulent evidence and potentially be reapproved.
///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change
///   their status, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream
///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.
///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an
///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all
///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the
///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an
///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in
///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. mistake in evidence), effecting a
///   "hard reset" at the contract storage level.
///
/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is
/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.
/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it
/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts. This is
/// important so that admins are only required to spend gas on useful actions.
///
/// In addition to `Approve`, `Ban`, `Remove` there are corresponding events
/// `RequestApprove`, `RequestBan`, `RequestRemove` that allow for admins to be
/// notified that some new evidence must be considered that may lead to each
/// action. `RequestApprove` is automatically submitted as part of the `add`
/// call, but `RequestBan` and `RequestRemove` must be manually called
///
/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the
/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.
/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role
/// for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship
/// resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the
/// end-user experience.
///
/// Ideally the admin account assigned at deployment would renounce their admin
/// rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts
/// with each specific role.
